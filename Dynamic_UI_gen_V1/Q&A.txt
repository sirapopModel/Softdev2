** Winform template note **

- Program.cs
1: [STA_Thread] = Single Thread Apartment (tell a computer this is single thread apartment application)

-Form1
--Form1.Designer.cs			// this one initial like dispose a resource to hardware after
* dispose mean release
1.disposing is parameter that will be true if the resouce monitor want to dispose a resource

--Form1.cs
	---Form1.cs [Design View] 
	---Form1.cs [Code View ] 
	The design view and Code View is connected with window form template for easily to design

--Form1.resx is the resource file from visual studio 

Note that read order will be build a Form class --> its property ---> public fuction name "Form1()" so you cant declare a UI component outside method !!
Cause Form1() do Initialize Component After read a property !!

Q&A part:

1. "this" key word what does it do --> ( is a key word used to refers instance of current class !! )

2. (class).Control mean ? --> All Ui component that from System class or this template ** used appearance from class Control
	Ex. - System.Windows.Forms.Control
   		A	-System.Windows.Forms.ScrollableControl
   		B	-System.Windows.Forms.ContainerControl
   		C	-System.Windows.Forms.Form
   A,B and C are inherit from Control that is sub class of System

   (in this situation we need to use method named "Add" to adding a UI component).
